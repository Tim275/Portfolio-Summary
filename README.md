# Cloud  :cloud: 

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üå©Ô∏è [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/Tim275/MyResumeAWS) |  AWS (S3, CloudFront, Lambda, DynamoDB), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, GitHub Actions |  Building a resume website hosted on AWS. The project involves creating a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, hosting it on S3, delivering it through CloudFront, and adding a visitor counter using Lambda and DynamoDB. Infrastructure is managed as code and a CI/CD pipeline is set up using GitHub Actions. |
|  :open_file_folder: [Serverless RestAPI with Typescript & DynamoDb (NoSQL) ]() | AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB), Serverless Framework, JavaScript, Typescript |     . The backend logic, written in Typescript, interacts with DynamoDB via several Lambda functions. These functions are invoked by API Gateway endpoints, which are triggered by client-side JavaScript. The entire serverless infrastructure is defined and managed using the Serverless Framework, ensuring efficient deployment and scalability. This architecture demonstrates a cost-effective, scalable, and resilient approach to web application development in the cloud. |
