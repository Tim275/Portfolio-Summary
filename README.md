# Cloud  :cloud: 

| Project Link | Tools | Project Description | 
|---|---|---|
| üåê [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://github.com/Tim275/MyResumeAWS) | AWS, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, Serverless Framework, Git, GitHub | Developed and implemented an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processing NYC Trip Record data. The pipeline encompassed extracting raw data, performing data transformation using Python, applying fact and dimensional data modelling techniques, orchestrating the pipeline on Mage, and ultimately creating a dashboard using Looker Studio. |
|  :open_file_folder: [Serverless RestAPI with Typescript & NoSQL (DynamoDb) ]() | AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB), Serverless Framework, JavaScript, Typescript |     . The backend logic, written in Typescript, interacts with DynamoDB via several Lambda functions. These functions are invoked by API Gateway endpoints, which are triggered by client-side JavaScript. The entire serverless infrastructure is defined and managed using the Serverless Framework, ensuring efficient deployment and scalability. This architecture demonstrates a cost-effective, scalable, and resilient approach to web application development in the cloud. |
